# LinkedinScrapper
The python program to export linkedin contacts


The program needs Chrome Browser and works with chromedriver, keep the chromedriver in the same directory as the python file

The program works in headless mode, if the linkedin asks for Captcha the program will handle the exception and will not fail but will fail to scrape the data
